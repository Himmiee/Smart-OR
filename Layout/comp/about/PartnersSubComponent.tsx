            At CREDICORP, we believe access to credit is access to opportunity.
            As Nigeria's Consumer Credit Corporation, we are committed to
            bending down financial barriers and empowering everyday Nigerians -
            students, artisans, salaried workers, small business owners - to
            build the lives they desire.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#090914]">
            We are a Federal Government-backed Development Finance Institution
            with a clear mission: to democratize consumer credit and make it
            work for the people. Through innovative systems, strategic
            partnerships, and a people-first approach, we're reshaping Nigeria's
            credit landscape, one person at a time.
